Recipes Page
=============

A basic HTML/CSS static page.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-recipes/)

Disclaimer
-----

This project was my very first attempt at web development as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and to contribute to the open-source community so that other students can learn from the same project stages.

Also, as directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects, like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design and styling of your website, and so on.
> 
> We recommend not doing that, and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on the requirements of the project.


About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum. It is the first project required for completion of the Foundations Course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Set up a GitHub repository.
- [x] Build a pure HTML/CSS page that links to 3 recipes.


What I Learned
-----

My first programming project! 

I learned the basics of web development, including setting up a development environment with WSL, using VS Code, creating an HTML/CSS static page, and understanding the basics of Git and GitHub.

Notes
-----

Well, it does look bad. But you have to start somewhere.

The design may not be ideal, but there's no point in improving it. The main goal here was to learn basic HTML/CSS/git.

I'll surely make much better-looking stuff in the near future. Stay tuned!
