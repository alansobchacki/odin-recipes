<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The holy rum ham, composed of the magical combination of rum and ham. A must-have for sailors, pirates, and anyone who just wants to be around lots of seamen.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 fully cooked ham, bone-in or boneless</li>
            <li>1 bottle of rum (dark or spiced)</li>
            <li>Pineapple rings (optional, for garnish)</li>
            <li>Maraschino cherries (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven.</li>
            <li>Remove any packaging or netting from the ham. If it has a layer of skin, leave it, it's extra protein.</li>
            <li>Place the ham in a roasting pan, fat side up.</li>
            <li>Pour rum over the ham.</li>
            <li>Cover the roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil or a lid to trap the moisture.</li>
            <li>Every 30 minutes, carefully remove the pan from the oven and baste the ham with the accumulated juices and rum.</li>
            <li>During the last 15 minutes of baking, you can add pineapple rings and maraschino cherries to the top of the ham for a classic touch.</li>
            <li>Let it rest and serve.</li>
        </ol>
